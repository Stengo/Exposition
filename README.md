# Exposition

## Getting Started
To configure signing without versioning getting in the way, please create a file named `DevelopmentTeam.xcconfig` in the `Configurations` folder.
In there you can specify your development team ID as:
```
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = *your team id* 
```
It'll then automatically be picked up by Xcode.
